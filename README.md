# A-GNN-APPROACH-TO-DETECTING-AUTOMOBILE-INSURANCE-FRAUD

Insurance claim fraud reduces earnings and causes significant losses in the vehicle insurance industry. As a result, various machine learning algorithms such as Nave Bayes, Bayesian, Network model, and others have been implemented to detect financial fraud; however, none of these approaches have been tested on a graph dataset. The goal of this study is to develop a Graph neural network for a node classification strategy to detect automobile insurance fraud. An automobile insurance dataset was pre-processed, and a comprehensive exploratory analysis was performed to reveal insights, the data was found to be imbalanced. The table dataset was transformed into a graph dataset to be used with the GNN model. The imbalance state of the graph dataset was rectified by sampling before utilizing it to create a model. Using an 80/20 approach, the graph dataset was divided into training and testing datasets. Training sets were used to train models, and testing sets were used to evaluate their performance. Precision, recall, and the F-measure evaluation technique is used to confirm that the model is fit.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105867464/212572654-0b2d5f44-3b81-4835-a6b3-a61e5acd7f33.png)
